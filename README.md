# Rust HTTP server implementation

The goal of this project is to pick from where [The Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch20-00-final-project-a-web-server.html) left off and enhance its implementation from a simplistic & demonstrative state to a more robust implementation.


Such enhancements include:
- Swap calls to _unwrap_ with proper error handling.
- Document _Threadpool_ further and its public methods.
- Test the library's functionality.
