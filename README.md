# Rust HTTP server implementation

The goal of this project is to pick from where [The Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch20-00-final-project-a-web-server.html) left off and enhance it to become more useful and complete.

The enhancements / modifications will be documented and shared in my blog.
